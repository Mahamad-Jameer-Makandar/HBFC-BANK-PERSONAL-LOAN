# HBFC-BANK-PERSONAL-LOAN

HBFC Bank aims to accelerate its growth by converting existing depositors into personal loan customers while retaining them. The project analyzes a dataset of 5000 customers, exploring demographic details, customer-bank relationships, and responses to the last personal loan campaign. The primary goal is to construct a predictive model identifying prospective customers likely to apply for personal loans, laying the foundation for actionable insights from historical customer data.
